TODO list for the cans.user-make Ansible role
=============================================


- Make it possible to download user's SSH public key to a different
  folder depending on the user. I would not go much further than that
  though. If managing complex SSH access policy by dispatching keys to
  different folders is needed so they can be consumed by other roles or
  playbooks (cf. `cans.ssh-access`) then a specialized role should be
  devised I think;
- Find a way to not create the directory `user_make_ssh_key_download_dir`
  when it is not required. It may be created anyways, _e.g._ when all
  users have the state *'absent'*;
  Tryed something like this which is both overly complex and brittle:

      (user_make_users | default([]) | map(attribute='state') | default('present') | reject('equalto', 'absent') | list | length > 0 and
       (user_make_ssh_key_download or user_make_users | default([]) | map(attribute='ssh_key_download') | select | list | length > 0))

- Integration testing with EC2 (?!);
- Remove SSH public keys from EC2 when user is deleted;
